# Advanced-Data-Structures-In-Java
The capstone project for Coursera Course Advanced Data Structures in Java.

This course is offered at <a href="https://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a> and is part of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented">Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond Specialization</a>.

This is the third course of the Specialization, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-data-structures">Link to the course</a>.

Here's my <a href = "https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/9WBVA9AU6D8G">certificate</a> on completing the course.

The program I build throughout this course allows its user to find the optimial path between two points in a map. The following algorithms are implemented:
* BFS
* DFS
* Dijkstra
* AStar
